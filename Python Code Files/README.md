# Code Files
This section contains the code files I used to train and test the models for the project.

**Instructions**

	1. Counting_Bees_from_Trained_Models.ipynb has the code for counting bees and displaying on images. Make sure to pass in the trained model and update the folder pathways as needed.
	
	2. Faster_RCNN_Bee_Detection_Code.ipynb has the code to pull the dataset from Roboflow. Make sure to enter your custom API Key to download it. The rest of the code is training the model and testing for Detectron2's Faster R-CNN. Update folder pathways as needed. 
	
	3. YOLO_Bee_Detection_Code.ipynb has the code to pull the dataset from Roboflow. Make sure to enter your custom API Key to download it. The rest of the code is training the model and testing for YOLOv5 models (v5s, v5x, v5l, v5m, v5n). Update folder pathways as needed.
